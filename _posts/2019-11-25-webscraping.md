## Hello and welcome back to a very boring blog unless you're _really_ into very old newspapers.

### Webscraping Process

The exercise required us to scrape the “Dispatch”, download all issues of “Richmond Times Dispatch” from 1860-1865,available [here](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:RichTimes). This was done in the following steps.

1 Grab the source of the provided URL and paste into a regex editor.
2 Extract the URLs to the different issues:
* The URLs are in the format ```/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2006.05.0001```
