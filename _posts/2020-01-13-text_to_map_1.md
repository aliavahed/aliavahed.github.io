title: Text to Map (1 of 2)

_Happy new year. I'm kind of sick of the Daily Dispatch_

In this assignment we had to extract all the places mentioned in the Daily Dispatch and count their frequencies, and then match the place name to coordinates from Geonames (in order to prepare for mapping in them in the following lesson.
  
    
```
import re, os

source = "./in23/"
target = "./out23/"

lof = os.listdir(source)

tags = []
tgns = []

for f in lof:
    if f.startswith("dltext"): # fileName test        
        with open(source + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            text = f1.read()
            tags = re.findall(r'<placeName.+?<\/placeName>', text) #grab entire placeName tag and add to list
             # tags.append(place)

for i in tags: # create list of tgns
  m = re.search(r'\d{7}',i)
  if m:
    tgns.append(m.group())

dicFreq = {} #count frequencies of tgns
for i in tgns:
  if i in dicFreq:
    dicFreq[i]+=1
  else:
    dicFreq[i]=1

dicGeo = {}

with open("US2.txt", "r", encoding="utf8") as f2: #format Geonames into dictionary
  for line in f2:
    x = re.split("\s",line, 1)
    dicGeo[x[0]] = x[1] 
#print(dicGeo)

smalldic = {}

for i in dicGeo: #trim Geonames down to only relevant
  if i in dicFreq:
    smalldic[i] = dicGeo[i]

  
for i in smalldic: #parse Geonames data for place name and coordinates
  geoplace = re.split("\t", smalldic[i], 1)[0]
  coords = re.findall("(-?\d*\.\d*)", smalldic[i])
  lat = coords[0]
  lon = coords[1]
  smalldic[i] = "%s\t%s\t%s" % (geoplace, lat, lon)
  # print(smalldic)
  
resultsCSV = []

for key, value in dicFreq.items(): #create list of tab-separated freq and tgn
    if value > 1: # this will exclude items with frequency 1
        newVal = "%09d\t%s\t%s" % (value, key, smalldic[key])
        # newVal will looks like: `000005486 TAB 7012333`
        resultsCSV.append(newVal)

resultsCSV = sorted(resultsCSV, reverse=True) #sort tgns by most to least frequent
# print(len(resultsCSV))
# print(resultsCSV[0])

# saving
with open("places.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
    f9.write("\n".join(resultsCSV)) # combine records into one file
```
