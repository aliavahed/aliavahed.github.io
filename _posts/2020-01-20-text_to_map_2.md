Let's pick up where we left off. We have a list of place names now, with their coordinates and frequencies, that we can plug into QGIS to create a visual representation.

_Android alert: there is an Android app version of QGIS. It is allegedly not compatible with my device. I didn't research any further, but if you're a Chromebook user, it might work for you. I ended up borrowing a Mac to complete this exercise._

  
#### Map of Dispatch locations 

Since my code generated last week produced one file with totalled frequencies of occurrence, I generated a single map with frequencies plotted in QGIS.
