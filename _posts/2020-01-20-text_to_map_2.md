title: Text to Map (2 of 2)

Let's pick up where we left off. We have a list of place names now, with their coordinates and frequencies, that we can plug into QGIS to create a visual representation.

_Android alert: there is an Android app version of QGIS. It is allegedly not compatible with my device. I didn't research any further, but if you're a Chromebook user, it might work for you. I ended up borrowing a Mac to complete this exercise._

  
#### How to map    
```
import re, os

source = "./in23/"
target = "./out23/"

lof = os.listdir(source)

tags = []
tgns = []

for f in lof:
    if f.startswith("dltext"): # fileName test        
        with open(source + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
            text = f1.read()
            tags = re.findall(r'<placeName.+?<\/placeName>', text) #grab entire placeName tag and add to list
             # tags.append(place)

for i in tags: # create list of tgns
